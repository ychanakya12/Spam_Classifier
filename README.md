# Spam_Classifier
The Spam Classifier project uses a Kaggle dataset (e.g., SMS Spam Collection) to detect spam messages with ML models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression. It preprocesses text using TF-IDF, conducts EDA with word clouds, and applies SMOTE for class imbalance. Achieving ~90% accuracy, it enables spam filtering for secure communication.
